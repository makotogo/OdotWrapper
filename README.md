# OdotWrapper

This repository accompanies the IBM developerWorks Recipe: Android and the Cloud.

* ItemRestService.Ping - pings the server to return a simple greeting
* ItemRestService.FindAll - returns all Item entities in the DB

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS STATED OTHERWISE. PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ANY ISSUES OR PULL REQUESTS AGAINST THIS REPO.

Thanks, and enjoy the free code.
